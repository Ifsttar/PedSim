Flow equations and numerical schemes 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We essentially used flow equations and numerical schemes described in Stéphane Mollier’s thesis, « Two-dimensional models for large-scale traffic networks » [1] to construct the model. It uses conversation laws with a two dimensional density as described in equation (1) in [1].
